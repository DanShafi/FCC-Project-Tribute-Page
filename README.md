# FCC-Project-Tribute-Page

This repo has been created for the FCC Responsive Web Design course project #1: Tribute Page. The requirements of the project was to pass 10 different tests using HTML & CSS. The example project can be found here on the <a href="https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/pen/NNvBQW">FCC CodePen</a>.
Upon completion of the tests, I decided to focus on the CSS and Design aspect of the page by creating a likeness of the Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/stevejobs/" target="_blank">'Remembering Steve'</a> page, as my subject for the project was Steve Jobs.

You can see the live execution of my code on <a href="https://codepen.io/DanShafi/pen/xxGQEPj" target="_blank">CodePen</a>.
