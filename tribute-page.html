          <h3>In Rememberance</h3>
            <p>Steve Jobs, the American businessman and technology visionary who is best known as the co-founder, 
              chairman, and chief executive officer of Apple Inc, was born on February 24, 1955. Apple started with three men—Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, 
              and Mike Markkula—who together in the late 1970s designed and marketed the Apple II series of computers. 
              It was the first commercially successful line of personal computers, and led to the Apple Lisa in 1983—the first computer to use a mouse-driven GUI (graphical user interface).
              One year later, the Apple Macintosh was born and with it, the Apple legend began to grow.
            </p>

            <p>Within a few years, Apple was the technology that everyone wanted to own. The release of the iPod in November 2001 
              and then the iPhone in 2007, took Apple from a major player to the company everyone was trying to emulate.</p>
            
            <p>Between 2003 and his death in August 2011, Jobs underwent many procedures and therapies to 
              try and beat cancer, but the disease was too aggressive. 
              He stepped down as CEO of Apple on August 24, 2011, and died just a few weeks later.</p>
